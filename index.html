      <h1>Tomothy Tran</h1>
      <h2>Full-Time Student</h2>
      <p>
        I am a computer science student exploring the fields of an IT Support
        Specialist and Technical Writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that I am capable of providing exemplary work as a student
        assistant through my prior experiences of handling computer hardware and
        computer science projects. I am capable of satisfying my employers needs
        through my work ethic and laboratory management skills which has
        reinforced the foundation of my abilities in handling assignments and
        following instructed tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        My time in software engineering imparted the knowledge of how to sell
        and build a product from scratch, which bolstered my communication
        skills. The experience in collaborating with others, skills in making
        judgements when needed, as well as my abilities to communicate concisely
        will be the front of what I will provide for the workplace.
