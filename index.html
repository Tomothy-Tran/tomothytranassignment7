        <h2>Full-Time Student and Student Assitant Researcher</h2>
        <p>
          I am a computer science student exploring the fields of an IT Support

        <!-- <p>
          I believe that I am capable of providing exemplary work as a student
          assistant through my prior experiences of handling computer hardware and
          computer science projects. I am capable of satisfying my employers needs
          through my work ethic and laboratory management skills which has
          reinforced the foundation of my abilities in handling assignments and
          following instructed tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time in software engineering imparted the knowledge of how to sell
          and build a product from scratch, which bolstered my communication
          skills. The experience in collaborating with others, skills in making
          judgements when needed, as well as my abilities to communicate concisely
          will be the front of what I will provide for the workplace.
